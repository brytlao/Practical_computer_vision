Notes and implementation of codes in the book Practical Computer Vision by Abhinav Dadhich
Sections without coding exercises are simply mentioned or skipped in this repo.
The codes found here are modified to work with TensorFlow using the Google Colab environment.

Note about images:
- I mainly used personal images.
- However, some exercises require particular scenes to confirm the performance of the algorithms.
- In such cases, images from the book are used, unless an unmodified image cannot be obtained.
